## Web Development Journey

This website is part of my ongoing journey into web development. I started learning the fundamentals of frontend and backend development, and this project is my first attempt at building a professional website from the ground up. I used Angular 17, combined with TailwindCSS, to create a modern and responsive design for AMAL GROUP.

### Progress:

- Built the frontend using Angular, incorporating a clean, user-friendly layout.
- Implemented TailwindCSS for easy customization and responsive design.
- Worked through various challenges of setting up a GitHub Pages deployment with Angular.
- Gained hands-on experience with web development tools, databases, and version control.

## Features:

- **Responsive Design**: The website adapts to different devices and screen sizes.
- **Interactive UI**: The layout is designed to provide an engaging user experience.
- **Admin Dashboard**: Back-end functionality for easy management of content.

## Next Steps:

- Improve the functionality by adding more interactive elements.
- Integrate a backend to support dynamic content.
- Enhance the SEO and performance optimization for better visibility.

Feel free to explore the project and contribute to its improvement. Stay tuned for more updates!
